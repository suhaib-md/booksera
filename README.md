## 🧠 AI Implementation Details

### Hybrid Recommendation System
Our hybrid recommendation system combines collaborative filtering and BERT-based content analysis to provide personalized book recommendations. The system:

- Uses SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) for matrix factorization
- Generates BERT embeddings for book descriptions and metadata
- Dynamically adjusts weights between collaborative and content-based scores
- Implements diversity rules to ensure varied recommendations

### Mood-Based Recommendation System
The mood-based recommendation system matches books to users' emotional states using:

- 14 distinct mood categories with comprehensive emotional mapping
- BERT-based sentiment analysis to understand the emotional tone of books
- Multi-strategy scoring approach integrating semantic similarity and thematic matching
- Personalized recommendation reasoning for each suggested book

### AI-Generated Summaries 
Our summarization system employs transformer-based models (BART and T5) with:

- Adjustable summary lengths and styles (concise, standard, detailed)
- Sophisticated caching mechanism with SHA-256 hashing
- Pipeline architecture for preprocessing, generation, and post-processing
- Exponential backoff retry logic for improved reliability

### Cross-Media Recommendation System
The book-to-movie recommendation system uses:

- Sentence-BERT (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to generate content embeddings
- Custom genre mapping taxonomy between books and films
- Multi-stage candidate filtering and semantic similarity calculation
- Weighted scoring system considering narrative similarity, genre compatibility, and temporal proximity
